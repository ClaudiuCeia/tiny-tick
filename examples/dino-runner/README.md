# dino-runner

Small endless runner inspired by the Chrome dinosaur game.

## What this proves

- Runtime-scoped input + world state
- Scene lifecycle and reset flow
- Basic platform-style movement (jump + gravity)
- Obstacle spawning and collision-driven game over
- Asset pipeline usage with scope lifecycle
- Player sprite animation states (run/jump/hit)
- Action-timed SFX (jump/land/score/hit)
- Custom HUD font loading

## Controls

- Jump: `Space`, `W`, or `ArrowUp`
- Restart after game over: `R`

## Run

```bash
bun run example:dino-runner
```

Then open `http://localhost:5174`.

Optional pixel upscale (nearest-neighbor):

- `http://localhost:5174?pixelScale=2`
- `http://localhost:5174?pixelScale=3`
